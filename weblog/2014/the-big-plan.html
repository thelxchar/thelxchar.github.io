  <h1 align="center">The Big Plan</h1>
  <hr />

  <p>In order to start an interesting and a successful life, I need plans.
  This plan will lead to the creation of the LX character that complements and
  enhances my real life identity while it does for this character I am about
  to create.</p>

  <p>I want to be really intelligent, physically fit, fun, mature, and
  having a more, positive attitude, mindset, and personality..</p>

  The only way to be really intelligent is to study, I want to re-learn and
  learn these subjects:

  <ul>
    <li>Science: Physics, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Biology</li>
    <li>Mathematics: Pretty much every mathematics subjects in
    <a href="https://khanacademy,org">Khan Academy</a></li>
    <li>Language: Reading, Writing, Vocabulary, and Speaking</li>
  </ul>

  As for being fun, being "in" and creative should help. In order for me to be
  physically fit, I need to exercise using 2 PS3 games dedicated for fitness and
  do 5 push-ups and 5 sit-ups at least once a day is enough I could punch the
  boxing glove too. I think being  mature is respecting all types of people and
  dealing with them the right way is being mature. I need to train myself and
  discipline myself more in order to have a positive attitude, mindset, and
  personality. Of course, I must never stop learning, evolving, and improving.

  <p>I found learning resources in the internet, but I'll be mentioning what
  I'll be actually using. <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a> is a
  <abbr title="Massively Open Online Course">MOOC Provider</abbr> that
  offers free online courses from top universities for everyone to learn.

  Khan Academy is the best resource for learning Mathematics.</p>

  <p>I decided to start from the beginning because when I was younger, I
  lacked attention span and kept on drawing pointless stickmen -- which I
  regretted. Another reason I did this because I didn't wnat to just learn
  things intuitively (how it works), I also want to know why it works. I plan to
  do these in a fast pace which might complete 2 - 5 years.</p>

  <p>My feelings are excitement filled with curiosity in doing this goal because
  my next action will determine my future. </p>
