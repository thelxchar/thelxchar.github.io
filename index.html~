  <p>Welcome to my website! It's made by me, Alexander B. Falgui (<em>LX</em>
  for short) these reasons:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make a page dedicated for people who wants to know about me.</li>
    <li>Tell people what I did in the past, what I am doing in the present
    and what I will (or might) do in the future.</li>
    <li>To improve my reading and writing skills along with skills that
    I am interested in developing or enhancing in the <em>weblog</em>
    section.</li>
    <li>To tell the world of my projects, contributions and accomplishments
    in life.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This website is written using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML
  </abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>. In the future,
  This website will be coded in JavaScript and PHP -- and might include
  Python and/or Ruby. This website is written in Linux Debian 7.6 Wheezy</p>

  <p>The design is not original -- I admit it; This design is based on
  <a href="http://catb.org/esr/">esr</a>'s homepage. I liked his idea of
  using light graphics for everyone to access it with <em>less</em>
  problems.</p>

  <p>This page is the center of where I give information about myself; The
  <a href="about-me.html">about me</a> section is where I write about myself
  in curriculum vita form; The <a href="weblog.html">weblog</a> section is
  where I write about what I did in the past, what I'll do in the present
  and what I will (or might) do in the future -- told in first person
  perspective; and the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section is where
  I put my contributions to the internet and projects intended for learning and
  fun.</p>
